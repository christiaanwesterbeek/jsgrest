Postgres REST API server in JavaScript (a la PostgREST).

This is a bare-bones reimplementation of @begriff's fantastic PostgREST in JavaScript.

# Goals
* Maximum API compatibility with PostgREST
* Reasonable performance
* An implementation I can hack on (not being a Haskell coder, I can't do this with PostgREST)

# Progress
I'm just starting out here. Please feel free to reach out in any way you like.
My first focus will be a reduced core feature set - just basic reading, writing with some tests.

# And hey...
...at least I didn't call it *PostgrESt*.
