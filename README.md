# jsgrest [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/motiz88/jsgrest.svg?branch=master)]

Postgres REST API server in JavaScript (a la PostgREST).

This is a bare-bones reimplementation of [@begriffs](https://github.com/begriffs)'s fantastic
    [PostgREST] (https://github.com/begriffs/postgrest) in JavaScript.

# Goals
* Maximum API compatibility with PostgREST
* Reasonable performance
* An implementation I can hack on (not being a Haskell coder, I can't do this with PostgREST)

# Progress
I'm just starting out here. Please feel free to reach out in any way you like.
My first focus will be a reduced core feature set - mostly just basic reading and writing. See the
    [Specification] (https://github.com/motiz88/jsgrest/wiki/Specification) for details.

# And hey...
...at least I didn't call it *PostgrESt*.
